# minetest
modified version and mods creates by me... includes default textures I use to play and Summerfields texture pack ^^

How to install minetest in the same folder easy:
1.- download source.tar.gz (minetest and minetest_game)
2.- uncompress any way.
3.- open terminal into the folder of install and type: cmake . DRUN_IN_PLACE=1 && make -j2
DRUN_IN_PLACE=1 installs minetest like a portable (worlds, settings, etc) in the same folder.
4.- then install minetest_game into /games/ folder to play.

languages of development of minetest:
JSON
C++
LUA
